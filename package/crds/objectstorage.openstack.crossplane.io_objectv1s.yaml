                      A unique (within an account) name for the container.
                      The container name must be from 1 to 256 characters long and can start
                      with any character and contain any pattern. Character set must be UTF-8.
                      The container name cannot contain a slash (/) character because this
                      character delimits the container and object name. For example, the path
                      /v1/account/www/pages specifies the www container, not the www/pages container.
