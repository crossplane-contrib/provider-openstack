            region: |-
                - (Optional) The region in which to obtain the V2 Compute client.
                Flavors are associated with accounts, but a Compute client is needed to
                create one. If omitted, the region argument of the provider is used.
                Changing this creates a new flavor.
            rx_tx_factor: |-
                - (Optional) RX/TX bandwith factor. The default is 1. Changing
                this creates a new flavor.
            swap: |-
                - (Optional) The amount of disk space in megabytes to use. If
                unspecified, the default is 0. Changing this creates a new flavor.
            vcpus: |-
                - (Required) The number of virtual CPUs to use. Changing this creates
                a new flavor.

                - (Required) The source type of the device. Must be one of
                "blank", "image", "volume", or "snapshot". Changing this creates a new
                server.
            block_device.uuid: |-
                - (Required unless source_type is set to "blank" ) The UUID of
                the image, volume, or snapshot. Changing this creates a new server.
            block_device.volume_size: |-
                - The size of the volume to create (in gigabytes). Required
                in the following combinations: source=image and destination=volume,
                source=blank and destination=local, and source=blank and destination=volume.
                Changing this creates a new server.
            block_device.volume_type: |-
                - (Optional) The volume type that will be used, for example SSD
                or HDD storage. The available options depend on how your specific OpenStack
                cloud is configured and what classes of storage are provided. Changing this
                creates a new server.
            config_drive: |-
                - (Optional) Whether to use the config_drive feature to
                configure the instance. Changing this creates a new server.

                deletion enabled.
            hypervisor_hostname: |-
                - (Optional) Specifies the exact hypervisor hostname on
                which to create the instance. When provided, this parameter is included in
                the request to Nova, directing the scheduler to launch the instance on the
                specified host. Note: This option requires administrative privileges and a
                Nova microversion of 2.74 or later. Conflicts with personality. Changing
                this value forces a new instance to be created.
            image_id: |-
                - (Optional; Required if image_name is empty and not booting
                from a volume. Do not specify if booting from a volume.) The image ID of

                - (Required unless uuid or port is provided) The human-readable
                name of the network. Changing this creates a new server.
            network.port: |-
                - (Required unless uuid or name is provided) The port UUID of a
                network to attach to the server. Changing this creates a new server.

                resource,
                you still need to make sure one of the above points is satisfied. An instance
                cannot be created without a valid network configuration even if you intend to
                use openstack_compute_interface_attach_v2 after the instance has been created.
            personality: |-
                - (Optional) Customize the personality of an instance by
                defining one or more files and their contents. The personality structure is
                described below. Conflicts with hypervisor_hostname. Changing this rebuilds
                the existing server.
            personality.content: '- (Required) The contents of the file. Limited to 255 bytes.'
            personality.file: '- (Required) The absolute path of the destination file.'
            power_state: |-
                - (Optional) Provide the VM state. Only 'active', 'shutoff', 'paused'
                and 'shelved_offloaded' are supported values.
                Note: If the initial power_state is the shutoff or paused
                the VM will be stopped immediately after build and the provisioners like
                remote-exec or files are not supported.
            region: |-
                - (Optional) The region in which to create the server instance. If
                omitted, the region argument of the provider is used. Changing this
                creates a new server.
            scheduler_hints: |-
                - (Optional) Provide the Nova scheduler with hints on how
                the instance should be launched. The available hints are described below.
            scheduler_hints.additional_properties: |-
                - (Optional) Arbitrary key/value pairs of additional
                properties to pass to the scheduler.
            scheduler_hints.build_near_host_ip: |-
                - (Optional) An IP Address in CIDR form. The instance
                will be placed on a compute node that is in the same subnet.
            scheduler_hints.different_cell: '- (Optional) The names of cells where not to build the instance.'
            scheduler_hints.different_host: |-
                - (Optional) A list of instance UUIDs. The instance will
                be scheduled on a different host than all other instances.
            scheduler_hints.group: |-
                - (Optional) A UUID of a Server Group. The instance will be placed
                into that group. See reference
                for details on managing servergroup resources
            scheduler_hints.query: |-
                - (Optional) A conditional query that a compute node must pass in
                order to host an instance. The query must use the JsonFilter syntax
                which is described
                here.
                At this time, only simple queries are supported. Compound queries using
                and, or, or not are not supported. An example of a simple query is:
            scheduler_hints.same_host: |-
                - (Optional) A list of instance UUIDs. The instance will be
                scheduled on the same host of those specified.
            scheduler_hints.target_cell: '- (Optional) The name of a cell to host the instance.'
            security_groups: |-
                - (Optional) An array of one or more security group names
                to associate with the server. Changing this results in adding/removing
                security groups from the existing server. Note: When attaching the
                instance to networks using Ports, place the security groups on the Port
                and not the instance. Note: Names should be used and not ids, as ids
                trigger unnecessary updates.
            stop_before_destroy: |-
                - (Optional) Whether to try stop instance gracefully
                before destroying it, thus giving chance for guest OS daemons to stop correctly.
                If instance doesn't stop within timeout, it will be destroyed anyway.
            tags: |-
                - (Optional) A set of string tags for the instance. Changing this
                updates the existing instance tags.
            updated: '- The time when the instance was last updated.'
            user_data: |-
                - (Optional) The user data to provide when launching the instance.
                Changing this creates a new server.
            vendor_options: |-
                - (Optional) Map of additional vendor-specific options.
                Supported options are described below.
            vendor_options.detach_ports_before_destroy: |-
                - (Optional) Whether to try to detach all attached
                ports to the vm before destroying it to make sure the port state is correct
                after the vm destruction. This is helpful when the port is not deleted.
            vendor_options.ignore_resize_confirmation: |-
                - (Optional) Boolean to control whether
                to ignore manual confirmation of the instance resizing. This can be helpful
                to work with some OpenStack clouds which automatically confirm resizing of
                instances after some timeout.

                - (Optional) A string set to specify that this is a dynamic large
                object manifest object. The value is the container and object name prefix of the
                segment objects in the form container/prefix. You must UTF-8-encode and then
                URL-encode the names of the container and prefix before you include them in this
                header.
            region: |-
                - (Optional) The region in which to create the container. If
