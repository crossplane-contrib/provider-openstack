                associated. Defaults to false.

                resource,
                you still need to make sure one of the above points is satisfied. An instance
                cannot be created without a valid network configuration even if you intend to
                use openstack_compute_interface_attach_v2 after the instance has been created.
            personality: |-
                - (Optional) Customize the personality of an instance by
                defining one or more files and their contents. The personality structure
                is described below. Changing this rebuilds the existing server.
            personality.content: '- (Required) The contents of the file. Limited to 255 bytes.'
            personality.file: '- (Required) The absolute path of the destination file.'
            power_state: |-
                - (Optional) Provide the VM state. Only 'active' and 'shutoff'
                are supported values. Note: If the initial power_state is the shutoff
                the VM will be stopped immediately after build and the provisioners like
                remote-exec or files are not supported.
            region: |-
                - (Optional) The region in which to create the server instance. If
                omitted, the region argument of the provider is used. Changing this
                creates a new server.
            scheduler_hints: |-
                - (Optional) Provide the Nova scheduler with hints on how
                the instance should be launched. The available hints are described below.
            scheduler_hints.additional_properties: |-
                - (Optional) Arbitrary key/value pairs of additional
                properties to pass to the scheduler.
            scheduler_hints.build_near_host_ip: |-
                - (Optional) An IP Address in CIDR form. The instance
                will be placed on a compute node that is in the same subnet.
            scheduler_hints.different_cell: '- (Optional) The names of cells where not to build the instance.'
            scheduler_hints.different_host: |-
                - (Optional) A list of instance UUIDs. The instance will
                be scheduled on a different host than all other instances.
            scheduler_hints.group: |-
                - (Optional) A UUID of a Server Group. The instance will be placed
                into that group.
            scheduler_hints.query: |-
                - (Optional) A conditional query that a compute node must pass in
                order to host an instance. The query must use the JsonFilter syntax
                which is described
                here.
                At this time, only simple queries are supported. Compound queries using
                and, or, or not are not supported. An example of a simple query is:
            scheduler_hints.same_host: |-
                - (Optional) A list of instance UUIDs. The instance will be
                scheduled on the same host of those specified.
            scheduler_hints.target_cell: '- (Optional) The name of a cell to host the instance.'
            security_groups: |-
                - (Optional) An array of one or more security group names
                to associate with the server. Changing this results in adding/removing
                security groups from the existing server. Note: When attaching the
                instance to networks using Ports, place the security groups on the Port
                and not the instance. Note: Names should be used and not ids, as ids
                trigger unnecessary updates.
            stop_before_destroy: |-
                - (Optional) Whether to try stop instance gracefully
                before destroying it, thus giving chance for guest OS daemons to stop correctly.
                If instance doesn't stop within timeout, it will be destroyed anyway.
            tags: |-
                - (Optional) A set of string tags for the instance. Changing this
                updates the existing instance tags.
            updated: '- The time when the instance was last updated.'
            user_data: |-
                - (Optional) The user data to provide when launching the instance.
                Changing this creates a new server.
            vendor_options: |-
                - (Optional) Map of additional vendor-specific options.
                Supported options are described below.
            vendor_options.detach_ports_before_destroy: |-
                - (Optional) Whether to try to detach all attached
                ports to the vm before destroying it to make sure the port state is correct
                after the vm destruction. This is helpful when the port is not deleted.
            vendor_options.ignore_resize_confirmation: |-
                - (Optional) Boolean to control whether
                to ignore manual confirmation of the instance resizing. This can be helpful
                to work with some OpenStack clouds which automatically confirm resizing of
                instances after some timeout.

                with any character and contain any pattern. Character set must be UTF-8.
                The container name cannot contain a slash (/) character because this
                character delimits the container and object name. For example, the path
                /v1/account/www/pages specifies the www container, not the www/pages container.

                container and object before you include them in the header. Conflicts with source and
                content.
            date: |-
                - The date and time the system responded to the request, using the preferred

                time is always in UTC.
            delete_after: |-
                - (Optional) An integer representing the number of seconds after which the
                system removes the object. Internally, the Object Storage system stores this value in
                the X-Delete-At metadata item.
            delete_at: |-
                - (Optional) An string representing the date when the system removes the object.
                For example, "2015-08-26" is equivalent to Mon, Wed, 26 Aug 2015 00:00:00 GMT.
            detect_content_type: |-
                - (Optional) If set to true, Object Storage guesses the content
                type based on the file extension and ignores the value sent in the Content-Type
                header, if present.

                - (Optional) A string set to specify that this is a dynamic large
                object manifest object. The value is the container and object name prefix of the
                segment objects in the form container/prefix. You must UTF-8-encode and then
                URL-encode the names of the container and prefix before you include them in this
                header.
            region: |-
                - (Optional) The region in which to create the container. If
                omitted, the region argument of the provider is used. Changing this
                creates a new container.
